# Synthetic_Data_Evaluation-
Are my real and synthetic datasets random samples from the same parent distribution?

# Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the quality and realism of synthetic data generated from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using bivariate statistical analysis. Unlike univariate methods, which assess individual feature distributions, bivariate analysis examines relationships between feature pairs — ensuring that synthetic data preserves structural and diagnostic relationships present in real data.
